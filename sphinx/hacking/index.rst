Hacking
=======

eglib can be extended to support new display controllers and platforms or to have new drawing functions somewhat easily:

* Fork `eglib's Git <https://github.com/fornellas/eglib/>`_ and clone it.
* Visit :doc:`../usage/index` to learn how to setup a development version.
* Pick one of the guides below to get you up to speed.

If you have questions, please `reach out <https://github.com/fornellas/eglib/issues>`_.

Once you have working code, send a `pull request <https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request>`_ of your good work so others can benefit from it. If your change changed any documentation, make sure to run ``make update-html`` and add all changes before submitting your pull request.
